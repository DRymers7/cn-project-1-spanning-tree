    """
    This class defines a Switch (node/bridge) that can send and receive messages
    to converge on a final, loop-free spanning tree. This class
    is a child class of the StpSwitch class. To remain within the spirit of
    the project, the only inherited members or functions a student is permitted
    to use are:

    switchID: int
        the ID number of this switch object)
    links: list
        the list of switch IDs connected to this switch object)
    send_message(msg: Message)
        Sends a Message object to another switch)

    Students should use the send_message function to implement the algorithm.
    Do NOT use the self.topology.send_message function. A non-distributed (centralized)
    algorithm will not receive credit. Do NOT use global variables.

    Student code should NOT access the following members, otherwise they may violate
    the spirit of the project:

    topolink: Topology
        a link to the greater Topology structure used for message passing
    self.topology: Topology
        a link to the greater Topology structure used for message passing
    """

    """
    Notes:
    StpSwitch send_message: wrapper to invoke so we do not have to use method in Topology directly.
    Message: message used to communicate between switches, instantiated by: msg = Message(claimedRoot, distanceToRoot, originID, destinationID, pathThrough, timeToLive)

    Each node must keep track of the best config message it has received so far, and compare against config message it is receiving from neighbors that round.
    Node ID 3 first sends <3, 3, 0> -> between two configs, the node selects that one config is better if:
    - Root of the config has a smaller ID or:
    - Smaller distance from the root
    - Ties are broken with smallest ID
    - Stop sending messages over links when the node receveis a message that indicates it is not the root (either neighbor closer to root, or same distance but
    smaller ID)

    What I need to do: 
    1. Use a data struct to keep track of spanning tree
     - Must act in such a way to track each switch's own view of the three.
     - Switch only has access to its member variables, to learn from a neighbor, the neighbor must send a message.
    2. Data struct:
     - var to store switch ID that this switch sees as root (every switch should start assuming it is the root)
     - var to store distance to switch root
     - list to store active links
     - var to keep track of which neighbor it goes through to get to the root (ID I'm assuming)
    3. Implement processing messages from immediate neighbor
     - Determine whether root info update is needed (if receive message with lower claimedRoot)
     - Update distance stored in data struct if switch updates the root or there is a shorter path to the same root
     - Update switches active links (switch updates the root or there is a shorter path to same root)
     (ref 2b)
    4. Keep sending until TTL == 0
    5. Write logging function
